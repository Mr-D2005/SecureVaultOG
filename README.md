🔐 SecureVault

SecureVault is a cloud-integrated secure communication system designed to protect sensitive data through a combination of encryption, steganography, and AI-based detection. The platform ensures that information is not only encrypted but also concealed and monitored for potential misuse.

📌 Overview

SecureVault enables users to securely transmit and store confidential information by:

Encrypting messages using strong cryptographic techniques
Embedding encrypted data within images using steganography
Storing data securely in cloud infrastructure
Detecting hidden content using AI-based analysis

This project demonstrates the integration of cloud services, cybersecurity practices, and intelligent systems into a unified application.

🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture consisting of:

Frontend: React (Vite) based user interface
Backend: API-driven service layer (Flask-based)
Cloud Layer: AWS services for storage and key management
Security Layer: Encryption, hashing, and steganography
AI Layer: Detection of hidden data in images
